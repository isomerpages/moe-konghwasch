<h3>Physical Education</h3>
<p>Our Physical Education (PE) programme aims to develop students in both
physical skills and social emotional competencies.&nbsp; The physical skills
comprise of fundamental movement skills in lower primary and games skills
and concepts in upper primary. Along with these skills, students learn
the values of teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship. Through a game-based
learning approach, opportunities are created for students to develop critical
thinking skills and problem-solving skills in game-like situations.</p>
<p>Health Education and Nutrition is part of the PE curriculum. The content
covers good habits and practices when doing physical activities. It also
covers good eating habit and making the right food choice. By starting
the students young, they will pick up the good habits which will benefit
them and the community in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
