### Physical Education

#### PE Curriculum

To ensure every Kong Hwaian is physically active and fit, PE lessons are planned to be fun and robust where students learn knowledge, attitude and fundamental skills such as throwing and catching, as well as various folk dances and games concepts. Besides learning skills to master the fundamental movements, dance and rhythm, students learn to live and demonstrate the values such as fair play, sportsmanship, teamwork and consideration for others as they play, dance, exercise and interact with their classmates.

  

PE plays an important role in the overall holistic development of the students and paves the way to inspire and lead the students to live a healthy and active lifestyle throughout their life.
