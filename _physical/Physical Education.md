### Physical Education

Our Physical Education (PE) programme aims to develop students in both physical skills and social emotional competencies. These will help our students to achieve an array of fundamental movement skills and proficiency in usage of sport equipment when engaging in games with their fellow peers. Along with these skills, students learn the important values of teamwork, resilience and sportsmanship during PE lessons.
While focusing on enhancing the various sensory development of our students, we also aim to challenge them to use critical thinking and problem-solving skills in game like situations. Through this, the PE department teachers strive to develop a positive impact on students through inculcating lifelong love for physical activities and leading a healthy and active lifestyle.
