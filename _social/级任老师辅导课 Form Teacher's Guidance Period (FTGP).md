### Form Teacher's Guidance Period (FTGP)

**CCE(FTGP)**

CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.

Form Teachers also take the time to have one-to-one chats with students. Through these additional informal check-ins, teachers strengthen rapport with students and build positive relationships.

Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught in CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. Students learn about developing healthy and rewarding relationships, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

**CCE(MTL)**

CCE (_formerly known as Civics and Moral Education_) is taught in the Mother Tongue Language as it holds rich sources of knowledge for the transmission of values. This also increases the amount of language exposure time for our students to enhance their learning of Chinese.

  

The questions and activities in the lessons help students relate to the stories, songs, and cultural practices that are set in different contexts and apply the learning to their current realities. Students are also provided with more opportunities to discuss and internalise the values.
