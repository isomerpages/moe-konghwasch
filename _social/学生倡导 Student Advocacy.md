<h3>Student Advocacy of Meaningful Causes</h3>
<p>At Kong Hwa School, we want our students to take the lead, and in collaboration
with external organisations, we provide platforms for students to become
advocates of good causes for the community.</p>

<p>Our P5 prefects demonstrate leadership qualities by guiding a team of
dedicated prefects through each project phase with meticulous planning
and attention to details.</p>
