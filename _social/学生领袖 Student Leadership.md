<p><strong>Vision:</strong> Leaders who serve with sincerity</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> To develop leaders who have sound moral values
and a passion to learn and serve</p>
<p>KHS holds the belief that every student has the potential to become a
leader. Essential leadership qualities are cultivated through learning
and development. The school has established a structured leadership programme
comprising three tiers of Student Leadership Progression: Personal Leadership,
Peer Leadership, and Service Leadership.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>3-Tier Student Leadership Progression</strong>
</p>
<p>In Student Leadership, the structure of the <strong>Student Leadership Development </strong>(SLD)
Framework follows a progression in leadership development (Grow–Influence–Serve),
starting with Personal Leadership (I am a Responsible Leader), advancing
to Peer Leadership (I am a Positive Influencer), and culminating in the
highest level of Service Leadership (I am a Student Advocate).</p>
