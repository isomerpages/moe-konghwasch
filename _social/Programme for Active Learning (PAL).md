### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

At Primary 1 and 2 levels, PAL offers hands-on and experiential learning through the domains of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, and Visual and Performing Arts. It provides opportunities for students to discover new interests, develop character and enable them to cultivate social-emotional competencies.

  

PAL contributes to the development of dispositions in our students such as having a lively curiosity about the world they live in, the ability to cooperate with others, and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.
