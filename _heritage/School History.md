### School History

**Kong Hwa School:**

**The Milestones:**

**Our Beginning (1951- 1953)**

**初升的朝阳**

**1951** 

In the early years immediately after the Japanese Occupation, there was a drastic shortage of schools in Singapore. The late Mr Tan Lark Sye, Chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan at that time, and the committee members realised the urgent need for education and, in line with the Huay Kuan’s aim to help the community to solve the serious problems of education, decided to build Kong Hwa School.

  

The plot of land where Kong Hwa School situates was donated by the late Mr Tan Lark Sye, and the late Dr Lee Kong Chian spearheaded the donation drive with a personal donation of $300,000.

  

Construction of Kong Hwa School started in 1951 in Guillemard Road which was then a swampy area. 

  

在第二次世界大战日军投降后的几年，新加坡面临学校供需严重失调的问题。当时，身为福建会馆主席的陈六使先生，与会馆委员会的理事们意识到人民对教育的迫切需求。  为秉持会馆的宗旨――“全面照顾人民的福利，特别是在教育方面”，福建会馆决定创办“光华学校”，以推广教育及弘扬中华文化。

  

各位先贤对于建校办学义不容辞，陈六使先生捐献了大片土地，李光前先生也以个人名义捐赠了三十万新元来兴建光华学校。 

  

光华学校于 1951 年建于基里玛路的沼泽地。 

  

**1952** 

Mr Lau Siu Ching was appointed the first principal of the school.

  

刘守潜先生受委为光华学校的首任校长。 

  

**1953** 

Kong Hwa School opened its doors and began providing education to children in the suburban area. 

  

The school was originally named after Dr Lee Kong Chian. However, at his request and after much thought and discussion, the Executive Committee decided to rename it “Kong Hwa School” . 

  

光华学校正式启用，开始为郊区儿童提供教育。

  

光华学校原名为“光前学校”，这是福建会馆为了表彰李光前先生对教育事业的伟大贡献而命名的。然而，李光前先生致函福建会馆主席，在信上说“教育慈善均应为大众化事业”，不应以他个人命名，再三要求改名。会馆董事部最后决定尊重李光前先生的意愿，将学校更名为“光华学校”。 

  

**Our Growth (1954-1991)** 

**跃升与成长** 

**1956** 

In 1956, with the relocation of the airport and the building of Merdeka Bridge, Guillemard Road became a main road linking to the town area. Flats were built and pupil population increased to one thousand and seven hundred. 

  

1956年，随着加冷机场迁至巴耶里峇，及独立桥的落成和启用，基里玛路不仅成为通往市区的主要公路，周围也建造了许多组屋。种种因素促使这一带的人口大幅度增加，而光华学校的学生也激增至 1700 名。

**1957** 

In April 1957, the school accepted the government’s full grants-in-aid. 

  

一九五七年四月，光华学校接受政府拨款资助。 

  

**1960** 

At the end of 1960, Hokkien Huay Kuan bought over sixty thousand square feet of land at a cost of $90,000 to construct a secondary school wing. When Nan Chiau Girls' High was reconstructed on site, its students were housed in the new Kong Hwa Wing. 

  

When the rebuilding of Nan Chiau Girls' High school was completed, Hokkien Huay Kuan and Chung Cheng High School committee members met and came to an agreement that the Kong Hwa Wing be exchanged for the Chung Cheng Branch School at Kim Yan Road .

  

In the second semester of 1960, Mr Lau Siu Ching left his post. Hokkien Huay Kuan moved one of its sponsored school principals, Mr Ngo See Kwee, from Nan Chiau Girls’ High to head Kong Hwa in 1961. 

  

鉴于学校发展迅速，福建会馆于1960年，拨款9万余元购买本校隔邻的空地6万余平方英尺，准备建筑新校舍增办中学。后来南侨女中重建，学校搬到本校隔邻的新校舍上课。

  

南侨女中新校舍建筑完工后，福建会馆和中正中学董事部达成协议，基里玛路的新校舍与金炎路的中正分校校舍对换，于是中正中学成为本校的邻居。

  

1960年第2学期，刘守潜先生卸下了校长职务。福建会馆调聘属校南侨女子中学代理校长――吴师逵先生于 1961 年起接任校长一职，成为光华学校第二任校长。 

  

**1963**

Kong Hwa continued its growth as it moved into its 10th year. At its peak, there were 56 classes, 5 Kindergarten classes, 87 teaching staff and the student population stood at 2,540.

  

光华在10 年，依然持续大幅度地成长，跃升到最高峰。全校共有56个班，幼稚园5班，教职员87人，学生多达两千五百四十名。

  

**1970** 

When Mr Ngo See Kwee retired from the service, Mr Ng Soh Beng took over the role of principal of the school .

  

吴师逵校长退休，由在光华服务多年的黄叔明先生接掌校务。

  

**1986** 

Mr Ng Soh Beng resigned from the post of principal. The position was left vacant and duties were covered by the senior teachers of the school from 1986 to 1987.

  

黄叔明校长辞卸校长职务。由于一时没有适当人选， 1986 及 1987 年校长一职悬空，由高级教师代行。

  

**1988** 

Mr Lam Kam Choon was appointed as the principal. 

  

林锦泉先生出任校长。

  

**1991** 

Mrs Pang Hong Tin was appointed as the principal.

  

李以星女士担任校长一职。

  

**Scaling Greater Height (1992-2012)** 

**再创高峰**

**1992** 

In 1992, the school was awarded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in recognition of its continued good performance at the PSLE and its strong emphasis on the learning of Chinese and its culture.

  

The Kong Hwa School Alumni was inaugurated as a society on 10th November 1992. It provided a platform for the alumni to network, contribute and support school activities and programmes.

  

To facilitate the upgrading of the new school building, Kong Hwa School was temporarily housed at 610 Aljunied Road, the former Aljunied School building.

  

1992年，由于光华学校连年获得优异的会考成绩，以及在传承中华传统文化方面表现不俗，教育部因此将本校列为全国 15 所特选小学（ SAP ）之一。

  

校友会于同年 11 月 10 日获社团注册局批准。校友会的成立，除了加强联系校友外，也让新旧校友多了互识互动的平台。最重要的是校友们能实现对母校“饮水思源，回馈母校”的心愿，得以落实。

  

1992年底光华迁至阿裕尼的旧实明小学上课，以方便学校在原址重建。

  

**1996** 

Topping up ceremony for the reconstruction of Kong Hwa School building was officiated by Mr Wee Cho Yaw, then Chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan. 

  

Moving back ceremony - Guests, pupils, parents and Kong Hwa School's Alumni members witnessed a very solemn but symbolic moment on the morning of 26 th October 1996. The torch relay was flagged off at Kong Hwa Aljunied and it ended at Kong Hwa Guillemard. 

  

福建会馆前主席黄祖耀先生主持重建校舍盖顶仪式。 

  

1996年10月26日我校举行新校舍落成迁返仪式。国旗自阿裕尼临时校舍降下。由校友、老师及学生沿途跑步护送至基里玛路新校舍。 

  

**1997** 

The new building, costing $14 million , was completed at the end of 1997. 

  

耗资一千四百万的光华学校新校舍于年底竣工。

1998年6月李以星校长荣休，由张莉莲女士掌校。

  

**1999** 

Kong Hwa’s Very Supportive Parents (VSP) was established in April, fostering greater opportunities for school-parent collaboration.

**2003** 

Ms Chong Lee Lian completed her term as a principal of Kong Hwa School, with Mr Ong Lye Whatt taking over the helm as the 7th principal of the school the following year. 

  

张莉莲校长于12月任满后，王来发先生与隔年担任光华学校第七任校长。 

  

**2008** 

In 2008, the school was awarded the School Distinction Award (SDA); one of the two pinnacle awards under the MOE Masterplan of Awards. It was also validated by Spring Singapore and conferred the Singapore Quality Class (SQC). The awards are a testimony of the many processes and systems that the school has put in place to deliver quality education. 

  

光华学校获得教育部在实施总体规划教育方针所颁予的崇高荣誉――“卓越学校奖”及由新加坡标新局所颁发的“新加坡素质级机构证书”。 

  

**2010** 

Kong Hwa School underwent its second upgrading in 2010. This time, the school shifted to its holding site at the former MacPherson Secondary School in Circuit Road. 

  

光华学校在2010年再次展开学校重建与翻新计划，期望在扩建后提供更理想的学习环境、更完备的教学设施，让学生们在良好的学习氛围中学习与成长。 

  

2010年，学校暂时迁移至阿裕尼的前柏盛中学。 

  

**2012** 

Upon completion of its new campus, the school was able to shift back in mid-2012. To celebrate the Moving back, a relay-walk from Circuit Road to Guillemard Road was organised with participation from Hokkien Huay Kuan, alumni members, parents, teachers and pupils. With this symbolic walk back, it began yet another chapter in the history of Kong Hwa School . 

  

2012年年中，位于基里玛路的光华学校新校舍圆满竣工。光华学校在6月29日举办了盛大庄严的校舍迁返仪式，全体师生、校友及家长高高兴兴地参与其盛，共同见证这历史性的一刻，携手掀开光华校史的新篇章。
