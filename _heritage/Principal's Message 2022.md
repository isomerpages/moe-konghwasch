### Principal's Message 2022

我加入光华一晃眼已有一年的时间。光华，一所像家一样的学校，让我深深感受到家庭般的温暖。同学之间的淳朴友情、教师与学生的深厚感情、家长与学校的同心同行、校友与母校的浓浓情谊，这层层的情义将“光华人”紧紧地联系在一起。疫情期间，更显光华温情。学校在去年首度面对确诊病例挑战时，深受“全家人”的关心与支持，令我为之动容、为之鼓舞。

光华校训：诚毅，造就了一代又一代的杰出人士。光华学子在华族文化的熏陶和优良价值观的引领下，学会待人接物的传统美德以及精益求精的坚韧精神。学校致力于发掘孩子的潜能，使他们全面发展。光华学子在光华师长的引导下，积极学习，不断反思，以终生学习为目标，以奉献社会为己任。我由衷希望光华的孩子在成长的道路上逐步发现自我，不断超越自我，并饮水思源，回馈社会。

学校在传承华族传统文化的同时，也强调学生对多元文化社会的体悟。作为一所具有优良华族传统、强调双语、双文化的学校，我们尽心培育孩子正确的价值观，培养他们的双语能力，让他们了解东西方文化的精髓，并融入多元文化、多元种族的社会。

光华团队会持续为孩子营造一个良好的学习环境。看着孩子们健康快乐地成长，成为拥有良好品德，积极向上向善的学生，是我办学最大的动力和慰籍。愿您与我们携手同行，一家人相互扶持，共同爱护我们温馨的光华大家庭。

Time flies. It has been a year since I joined the Kong Hwa family, and it still warms my heart how familial this school is - this “home beyond home”. It is a place where our teachers and students build strong relationships with one another; a place where our very supportive parents walk with us in partnership to nurture our young; and a place where the bonds of our alumni with their alma mater hold strong. This familial bond was most evident when we faced our first confirmed COVID-19 cases last year. I remember feeling bolstered by the outpouring of care and unwavering support from every member of our Kong Hwa family – parents, teachers, students and alumni.

Our motto ‘Sincerity and Perseverance’ has guided generations of Kong Hwaians in their endeavours, in school and in life. Complemented by a strong rootedness in Chinese culture and tradition, our students develop values that shape their identity, be it in their relationships with others, or developing resilience in character. As educators, we seek to realise our Kong Hwaians’ potentials, developing them holistically and guiding them on their journey of self-discovery. In our pursuit of nurturing the whole child, we strive to develop our Kong Hwaians into reflective lifelong learners and active contributors with a commitment to serve. I wish for all Kong Hwaians to discover themselves - their strengths and their identity; better themselves – improving with each passing day; and humble themselves – with grace and gratitude, in service of the community and nation.

While rooted in Chinese culture, we exhort our students to embrace diversity. As a school with rich Chinese traditions and a strong bicultural emphasis, we take pride in nurturing students who are anchored on values, effectively bilingual, have a deep appreciation of Eastern and Western cultures, and contribute in a multicultural society.

To that end, we will continue to maintain a positive and conducive learning environment for our Kong Hwaians. Watching our children grow and learn with health, joy, character, and drive is my greatest motivation and fulfillment. Let us continue this journey together, with love and support from everyone in our Kong Hwa family.
