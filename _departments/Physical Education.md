### Physical Education 

  
**PE Curriculum**  
To ensure every Kong Hwain is physically active and fit, PE lessons are planned to be fun and robust where pupils learn knowledge, attitude and skills as fundamental as throwing and catching as well as various folk dances and games concepts. Besides learning skills to master the fundamental movements, dance and rhythm, pupils learn to live and demonstrate the values such as fair play, sportsmanship, teamwork and consideration for others as they play, dance, exercise and interact with their classmates.  
  
PE indeed plays an important role in the overall holistic development of the pupils and paves the way to inspire and lead the pupils to live a healthy and active lifestyle throughout their life.
