### Citizenship Education

Citizenship Education is comprised of National Education and Social Studies. We aim to equip our students with the attitudes, values and instincts of good, informed and concerned citizens.  
  
**Learning Journeys**  
  
Targeted at the head and the heart, our Learning Journeys aim to inform and develop in our students the love for their country. Through visiting meaningful and culturally significant national sites in Singapore, students learn to appreciate other cultures, and develop a deeper understanding of our country and how they can contribute to it.  
  
**National Education Show**  
  
The National Education Show allows students to understand the journey that Singapore has gone through in the nation-building process, in an entertaining and engaging way. An opportunity for them to preview the National Day Parade, students are instilled with the love for our country through the various displays, while taking heed of the trials and tribulations faced by our nation builders.
