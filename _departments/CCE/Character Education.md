**Values in Action Programmes (VIA)**  
  
The Values in Action level programmes actively involve students in various community projects. It provides a platform for students to serve the school and the community, preparing them for a lifetime of active citizenship and contribution. Through the process of serving, students acquire a strong sense of belonging to the community, commitment to caring for others, and develop empathy.

**FTGP and Values in Education Programmes**

The Values Education Programme is a supplementary programme that complements the Character Education Modules of MOE. It enhances students’ personal, social and emotional development, improving their social and communication skills. Each term, two school values are selected - setting the focus for the termly Values Talk, the classroom, and co-curricular activities; and allowing purposeful learning of social and emotional competencies.

**The termly Values are:**  
  
Term 1- Responsibility and Cooperation  <br>
Term 2- Honesty and Humility  <br>
Term 3- Respect and Integrity  <Br>
Term 4- Tolerance and Filial Piety

**Cultivating Positive Daily Habits**  
  
To help cultivate good life habits in students both in school and at home, Kong Hwa School has implemented daily classroom cleaning since 2016. Five minutes before dismissal daily, music is played and all students and teachers take up roles in cleaning their classroom.  
  
To complement the programme, a Buddy Clean Workshop in partnership with the National Environment Agency is conducted to aid students in picking up the skills required for cleaning and working as a team, as well as the values of cooperation and responsibility.

**Student Advocacy of Meaningful Causes**  
  
At Kong Hwa School, we want our students to take the lead, and in collaboration with external organisations, we provide platforms for students to become advocates of good causes for the community.  
  
The Ecobuddies programme is a collaborative project with Dunman High School. The programme guides our P4 and P5 Green Captains towards character and cognitive excellence through role-modelling by their DHS seniors, and the inculcation of appropriate environmental values and attitudes. The Green Captains learn to better manage themselves, build up better social relationships with their peers and become more aware of themselves through the Ecobuddies activities, gaining greater clarity on how they can do their part as Green Captains in environmental education.  
  
Our Kindness Ambassadors, or Friends of Singa, do their part in spreading the message of kindness. Every year, our Kindness Ambassadors plan and execute a kindness project during Kindness Week, focusing on a theme by the Singapore Kindness Movement, and reaching out to the hearts of the community and the school.

**Recognition and Affirmation of the Positive**  
  
Creating an environment conducive to joyful learning, Kong Hwa School recognises and affirms the positive in every child. Besides the termly Model Class Award that students work towards to as a class, stories are also shared during Assembly highlighting the individual demonstrations of positive behaviour by student exemplars. Through this focus on the positive, we want our students to learn with joy and look forward to their school experience.
