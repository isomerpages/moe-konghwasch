### Character and Citizenship Education
  
The CCE syllabus aims to inculcate values and build social and emotional competencies in our students, enabling them to thrive in a fast changing and globalised world. It develops students through an understanding of the values that define Singapore society, inspiring them to show concern about the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.  
  
Students learn values through three overarching big ideas - Identity, Relationships and Choices. These are diffused in six domains, beginning with the self and extending to the family, school, community, nation and the world.  
  
In addition, CCE Guidance Modules - Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Sexuality Education and Cyber Wellness (CW) - address students’ social-emotional and developmental needs. At the primary level, Form Teachers’ Guidance Periods incorporate ECG and CW topics into the classroom activities.  
  
School-based CCE complements the Guidance Modules, and maintains flexibility to meet the needs of the various student profiles in the school. Time is set aside during curriculum time to deliver school-based CCE activities and lessons on school values, as well as conduct assembly programmes related to CCE.  
  
Home-School-Community Partnership in CCE is important as parents are the first care-givers in developing the good character of their children. For CCE to be effective, what is taught in school should be reinforced at home. CCE lessons which feature a segment on “Family Time” provides suggestions for activities that strengthen the bonds between parents and their children. The lessons also suggest activities for Values-In-Action (VIA) which can be carried out as a family.
