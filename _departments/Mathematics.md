**Vision**  <br>
**Every Konghwaian, An Analytical Thinker and A confident and Creative Problem Solver**

In line with the vision, the Mathematics programme not only places emphasis on the appreciation of Mathematics as a practical and creative activity for pupils but also develops in them an interest in learning Mathematics and perseverance in solving Mathematics problems.

  
**Joy of Learning in Mathematics through Experiential Learning**  
To nurture the joy of learning in mathematics, meaningful learning experiences were designed to encourage active learning through play. Students have fun with mathematics through learning experiences that help to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, and to make sense of various mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications.
