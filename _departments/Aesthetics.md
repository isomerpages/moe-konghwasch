**我们的座右铭：**  

提高光华学生美术创作的激情并培养他们对美术的鉴赏能力。  

**Our Motto:**  

Developing every Kong Hwaian with a passion and an appreciation for arts.  
  

  

**视觉艺术**

在光华学校的六年学习生涯中，我们的学生将接触多方面的中国与西方艺术。  
  
我们的视觉艺术课程包括了各种各样的艺术形式：图画、绘画、手工、陶瓷，艺术欣赏及数码艺术。同时，为了保有特选小学的特色，我们也着重于提供学生更多学习华文与接触华族文化的机会。有鉴于此，我们的二年级至四年级的美术课程也融入了由专业书法老师授课的书法与国画课。此外，我们也为小一生开办书法班，为他们提供在课余时间学习书法的宝贵机会。  
  
为了让学生通过不同的活动培养对美术的兴趣，光华学校每年都举办一次校内现场作画比赛与年终美术展。每一年的作画比赛都让学校发掘了不少才华出众，有美术特长的学生。每一年的年终美术展不止给予学生一个施展才华的舞台，所展出的学生佳作更是起了示范作用，鼓励学生积极参与美术欣赏。  

  

  
**音乐**  

在音乐教学中，学生将认识各类中国打击乐器，了解中国音乐历史并学习弹奏一样打击乐器。经过三年的培训后，学校为了提供学生展现音乐才华的机会，将安排一年一度的迷你音乐会，邀请家长前来观看演出。同时，各个班级也将轮流在校内的学生演出角落奏出悦耳动听的曲子，让休息时间也充满音乐旋律。通过这些活动，学校希望培养学生对音乐持久而浓厚的兴趣，更希望他们终身喜爱音乐。  
  
**Visual Arts** 

Pupils learn Chinese and Western arts in their six years of primary education in Kong Hwa School. They are exposed to various art forms like drawing, painting, craftwork, ceramic, art appreciation and digital art.  
  
As a SAP school with strong emphasis on pupil exposure to Chinese culture, the Primary Two to Four pupils learn Chinese Calligraphy and Chinese Brush Painting from the experts of these fields during their art lessons.  
  
School-based art competitions like the annual on-the-spot art competition are avenues to mine and discover talents in the area of visual arts for grooming. The annual year-end school-based art exhibition showcases and gives recognition to artistic pupils who excel in the area of visual arts besides encouraging the pupil population to engender greater appreciation of the arts.  
  
  
**Music**  

Every pupil is introduced to different types of musical instruments, learns the Chinese music history and acquires the skills of playing an instrument in their six years of primary education in Kong Hwa School. Pupils are given opportunities to perform before their peers as an affirmation of their effort and capabilities in music mastery. Pupils have many opportunities to perform either on stage or at the Pupils’ Platform where different classes are scheduled to perform weekly during recess time. The developmental school-based programmes aim to engender in the pupils the passion and love for music.
