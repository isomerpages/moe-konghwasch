### Character and Citizenship Education

#### Introduction

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is about learning, growth, and change. CCE in KHS is a journey that we take in partnership with our students, parents and stakeholders in education, and the wider community.

  

Our Department Vision is “A Culture of Positivity.” With the motto of&nbsp;_Knowing Good, Doing Good, and Being Good_, we develop in our students

*   Knowing Good through values education in the CCE curriculum frame

*   Doing Good through the enactment of CCE in Student Development Experiences; and

*   Being/Feeling Good through Positive Education, and the inculcation of positive daily habits and social-emotional competencies in our students.

  

In the context of our school motto, “Sincerity and Perseverance (诚毅)”, our students grow to be sincere in their identity and to persevere in their deeds.

#### CCE Curriculum

CCE in the classroom centres around three big ideas – Identity, Relationships, and Choices. These ideas are anchored on the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies for students to develop a greater sense of self and others, as well as the discernment to make good decisions.

  

To provide purpose for students, these fundamentals are taught and applied in the following contemporary real-world contexts:

*   National Education
*   Sexuality Education
*   Mental Health
*   Education and Career Guidance
*   Cyber Wellness
*   Family Education

  

Classroom lessons for CCE provide dedicated curriculum time for the explicit teaching and learning of values and social-emotional competencies, as well as engaging and building relationships with our students.
