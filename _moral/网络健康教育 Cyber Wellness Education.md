<h3>What is Cyber Wellness?</h3>
<p>According to MOE and MDA, Cyber Wellness refers to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Positive well-being of Internet users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of the norms of appropriate use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An understanding of the risks of harmful online behaviour</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Education:</strong>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>aim</strong>&nbsp;of the cyber wellness education is
to help students recognise the power of the web to benefit oneself and
the community, so that&nbsp;<strong>they have the skills and knowledge to thrive in this new world</strong>.</p>

<p>Goal of MOE’s Cyber Wellness Curriculum</p>
<p>To equip our children with&nbsp;<strong>life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values</strong>&nbsp;so
that they can become&nbsp;<strong>safe, respectful responsible users</strong>&nbsp;of
ICT.</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness Curriculum in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p>There are four cyber wellness themes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber use</strong>&nbsp;promotes balanced use of ICT. Are our
students in control of their ICT use or are they a slave to technology?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber identity</strong>&nbsp;promotes healthy self-identity online.
A well-developed identity enables us to know our strengths, weaknesses,
and individual uniqueness. Are they the same person both online and offline?
How do our students manage their online reputation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber relationship</strong>&nbsp;helps students maintain a safe
and meaningful one online. Do our students interact online with social-cultural
sensitivities? In the lesson on cyber bullying, we teach our students to
stand up for and to reach out to peers who are bullied online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber citizenship</strong>&nbsp;promotes positive presence through
helping students understand the cyber world, know how to handle online
content and manage contacts. Students learn to make informed decisions
about their online participation. Are free Apps really free? How can students
create and share their works online? The choices we make are guided by
values and reveal our character and value system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
