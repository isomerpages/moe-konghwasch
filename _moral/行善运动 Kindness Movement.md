### Kindness Movement

Our Kindness Ambassadors, or Friends of Singa, do their part in spreading the message of kindness. Every year, our Kindness Ambassadors plan and execute a kindness project during Kindness Week, focusing on a theme by the Singapore Kindness Movement, and reaching out to the hearts of the community and the school.
