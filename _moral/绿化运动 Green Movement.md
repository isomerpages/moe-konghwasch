### Green Movement

The Ecobuddies programme is a collaborative project with Dunman High School. The programme guides our P4 and P5 Green Captains towards character and cognitive excellence through role-modelling by their DHS seniors, and the inculcation of appropriate environmental values and attitudes. The Green Captains learn to better manage themselves, build up better social relationships with their peers and become more aware of themselves through the Ecobuddies activities, gaining greater clarity on how they can do their part as Green Captains in environmental education.
