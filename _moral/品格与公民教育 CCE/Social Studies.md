### Social Studies

The Social Studies curriculum complements the CCE curriculum in nurturing citizenship dispositions. Through Social Studies lessons, students deepen and broaden their understanding of what it means to be a citizen of a country and the world by learning key concepts and skills drawn from Humanities subjects like Geography, History and Sociology.

The lessons are reinforced with learning journeys to historically and culturally significant local sites, where students can get to see content they learn about in the Social Studies classroom come to life!
