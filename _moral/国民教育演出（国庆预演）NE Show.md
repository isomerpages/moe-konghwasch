### Learning Journeys

#### The NE Show

The National Education Show is a rousing opportunity for our Primary 5 students to develop greater understanding of our nation’s growth and a sense of belonging to Singapore. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our Primary 5 students to preview the National Day Parade with their classmates and teachers, their love for our country is strengthened through the show, while taking heed of the trials and tribulations faced by our nation builders.
