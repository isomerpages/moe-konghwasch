<p>KONG HWA VSP (Very Supportive Parents) was formed in 1999 with a Mission
to be the voice of Kong Hwa Parents for responsible and constructive feedback,
and be the catalyst for the improvement of the school learning environment
outside of what the Ministry of Education can do.</p>
<p>Formally registered as a society in October 2009, VSP is run by the VSP
Executive Committee (VSP EXCO) which is made up of a voluntary parents
only team that works closely with principals, teachers and other stakeholders
to steer the VSP Direction. There are many other registered VSPs who contribute
time or resources on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>We like to invite you to join VSP. If you are interested in journeying
with the school to enrich your children’s education life balance and can
commit time and resources, either on a regular or ad-hoc basis, we encourage
you to fill the form and indicate your areas of interest.</p>
<h4>Key Objectives</h4>
