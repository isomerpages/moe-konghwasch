### Science

<b><i>Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”</i></b>

**_\-    Carl Sagan (1934 – 1996)_**

#### Vision

**Every Kong Hwaian an analytical and creative inquirer**

  

To realise our vision, the Science department aims to leverage students’ curiosity, enable them to use scientific methods of inquiry to understand the world around them and encourage them to learn for life.  
  
When students develop analytical thinking, there will be a greater understanding of Science in their daily life and also their responsibility towards the society and environment.  
  
When students develop their creativity, they can better apply their scientific skills and knowledge in roles contributing to the society and environment.

#### Kong Hwa School Science Learning Experience

In line with MOE’s Science Curriculum Framework, the Kong Hwa School Science learning experience seeks to enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives; and provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

The inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry helps to increase students’ conceptual understanding of Science, their engagement in learning and also helps to ensure that joyful learning can flourish in school.

The department organises key science investigations, projects, enrichment activities and learning journeys at each level to allow ample opportunity for students’ hands-on learning. Students are also encouraged to use their scientific skills and knowledge to tinker and create unique products demonstrating science concepts which are exhibited through various platforms. This helps to develop students’ love for the subject, pride in their work and also enhances the learning for others who view their work and appreciate their efforts.
