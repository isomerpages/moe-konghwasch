<h3>ICT</h3>
<p>The Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) Department seeks
to develop competencies in our students for self-directed and collaborative
learning through the use of ICT and become discerning and responsible ICT
users. We aim to build a culture of innovation and a community of designers
and facilitators of meaningful tech-mediated learning experiences by supporting
the continuous professional learning and development of our teachers. We
believe in creating a responsive and flexible ICT learning environment
in school and accessibility to learning resources from home to support
learning anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>The ICT Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>New Media Literacies Programme</strong>&nbsp;will equip
every student with the fundamental ICT skills to be a future-ready digital
learner.</p>
