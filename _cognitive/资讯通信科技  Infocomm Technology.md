### ICT

The Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) Department seeks to develop competencies in our students for self-directed and collaborative learning through the use of ICT and become discerning and responsible ICT users. We aim to build a culture of innovation and a community of designers and facilitators of meaningful tech-mediated learning experiences by supporting the continuous professional learning and development of our teachers. We believe in creating a responsive and flexible ICT learning environment in school and accessibility to learning resources from home to support learning anytime and anywhere.  

**The ICT Experience**

The&nbsp;**New Media Literacies Programme**&nbsp;will equip every student with the fundamental ICT skills to be a future-ready digital learner.
