This programme aims to:

*   develop studentsâ€™ confidence, analytical and problem-solving competencies
*   expose students to areas of STEM and how technology can improve our way of life.

Under this programme, students attend training sessions on Design Thinking, Artificial Intelligence for Kids (AI4K), coding, pitching and presentation skills. Thereafter, they work in groups of 4 and propose creative solutions that make use of Design Thinking and AI4K methodologies to solve authentic problems under the mentorship of their teacher-facilitators.

During the programme, students come up with prototypes of their solutions, record their video presentations and submit Powerpoint presentations which describe their proposed solution and explain their ideation process.

The Thinkers Programme culminates in a Thinkers Showcase at the end of the year where the best teams from all 5 SHHK schools come together and pitch their solutions to a panel of judges.
