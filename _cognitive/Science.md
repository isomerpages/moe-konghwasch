### Science

<b><i>Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”</i></b>

**_\-    Carl Sagan (1934 – 1996)_**

#### Vision

**Every Kong Hwaian an analytical and creative inquirer**

  

To realise our vision, the Science department aims to leverage students’ curiosity, enable them to use scientific methods of inquiry to understand the world around them and encourage them to learn for life. When students develop analytical thinking, there will be a greater awareness of their responsibility towards the society and environment. When students develop their creativity, they can better apply their scientific skills and knowledge in roles contributing to the society and environment.

#### Key Highlights of the Kong Hwa School Science Programme

The Kong Hwa School Science Curriculum Framework (below) is closely aligned to MOE’s Science Curriculum Framework and highlights the key pedagogical approaches of the department. The inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry helps to increase students’ conceptual understanding of Science, their engagement in learning and also helps to ensure that joyful learning can flourish in school.

The department organises key science investigations, projects, enrichment activities and learning journeys at each level to allow ample opportunity for students’ hands-on learning. Students are also encouraged to use their scientific skills and knowledge to tinker and create unique products demonstrating science concepts which are exhibited through various platforms. This helps to develop students’ love for the subject, pride in their work and also enhances the learning for others who view their work and appreciate their efforts.
