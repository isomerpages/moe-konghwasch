### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

Our LLP programme aims to enrich our students’ experience with physical activities which further develops their fundamental movement skills and lifelong learning for sports. Collaborating with ActiveSG through Schools Sports Partnership Programme (SSP), students develop their physical movement skills ranging from individual work to collaboration with groups in team games.

#### P5 Camp

Through the camp, we seek to provide a platform for our students to learn through incorporating adventure learning and character development in an authentic outdoor setting. Another main focal point was to impart the values of teamwork, cooperation and confidence building through various challenges conducted by trained instructors in the camp. The activities required students to gain experiences beyond their comfort zones and come together to explore solutions for complex situations.

#### Annual SHHK Combined School Sports Meet

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no Sports Meet was conducted from 2020 – 2022. However, with the improvement of the situation, the Sports Meet will be held this year on 19 May 2023 at Bishan Stadium.
This is one of the events our students and staff were looking forward to. Held annually, our student athletes pitted their skills and talents against fellow competitors from various SHHK Schools, they were also enthusiastically cheered by their fellow Kong Hwaians who were seated at the spectators gallery. Through the competition, our student athletes also build on friendship and comradery with fellow competitors from other SHHK schools.
