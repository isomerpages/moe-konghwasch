<h4><u>KHS Learning for Life Programme</u></h4>
<p>The KHS Learning for Life Programme (LLP) –<strong> Triple Ex @ KHS</strong> adopts
a holistic approach in promoting active participation in physical activities
and inculcating a lifelong love for sports and the outdoors.&nbsp; The
programme is made up of three components, <strong><em>Exposure, Experience and Excel</em></strong>,
and is anchored in values. It is a value-based programme that allows students
to build character, team spirit and responsibility. Through the participation,
we aim to inculcate a lifelong learning for physical activities and promote
a healthy and active lifestyle in our students.</p>
<p>The lessons are conducted with modified rules and equipment to allow students
to experience success and learn in a non-threatening environment. Students
are encouraged to persevere in their learning. Gradually they will be prepared
to play the actual games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>KHS Play@Recess</u></h4>
<p>Play is key to children's learning, development, confidence, and wellbeing.
KHS Play@Recess allows students to play in a supportive and inclusive environment.
Students are taught basic etiquette such as sharing, taking turns, being
mindful of the surroundings, respecting school property, and keeping the
school clean. Through the teachable moments during recess play, students
learn to understand themselves better, develop social skills and practise
values.</p>
