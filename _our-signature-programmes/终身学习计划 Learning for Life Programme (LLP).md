<h4><u>KHS Learning for Life Programme</u></h4>
<p>The KHS Learning for Life Programme (LLP) –<strong> Triple Ex @ KHS</strong> adopts
a holistic approach in promoting active participation in physical activities
and inculcating a lifelong love for sports and the outdoors.&nbsp; The
programme is made up of three components, <strong><em>Exposure, Experience and Excel</em></strong>,
and is anchored in values. It is a value-based programme that allows students
to build character, team spirit and responsibility. Through the participation,
we aim to inculcate a lifelong learning for physical activities and promote
a healthy and active lifestyle in our students.</p>
<p>The lessons are conducted with modified rules and equipment to allow students
to experience success and learn in a non-threatening environment. Students
are encouraged to persevere in their learning. Gradually they will be prepared
to play the actual games.</p>
