<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Every Kong Hwaian an Effective Communicator</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is designed to develop students’
communication skills in the English language through engaging and meaningful
learning experiences. It spans across three blocks - lower primary, middle
primary, and upper primary. Adopting a spiral approach, students get to
explore their voices and creativity through a gradual development of skills
over six years where they build their confidence to be effective communicators
while having a blast learning together.</p>
<p>In building up expressive oracy skills in the foundation years, through
reading techniques such as choral reading and recitation, lower primary
students learn about body language, word stress, rhythm, tone and volume.
Students explore Moo-O, which is an app that provides them a meaningful,
engaging and fun way to master their language skills, with focus on reading
fluency and speaking skills. It transforms students’ learning experiences
by allowing them to become story characters in real-time and enabling them
to create videos to share their narratives. Through the spelling games
and the videos they produce, students demonstrate the language skills they
have acquired.</p>
<p>At middle primary, students engage in Literary Appreciation and Readers’
Theatre for a more creative and immersive experience. Literary appreciation
encourages critical thinking and emotional connection with texts, fostering
a deeper love for reading and writing. Students engage in discussions and
analysing different literary elements enhance this appreciation. Through
Readers’ Theatre, students improve reading fluency, develop a richer understanding
of texts and engage with literature in meaningful ways. Students' learning
is then culminated in video recordings created with Newsmaker, allowing
them to take on the role of their favourite characters in the stories.</p>

<p>Broadcast Journalism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KHS Live! In Primary 5, students are exposed to a two-tier broadcast journalism
programme. The first tier equips all students with basic journalistic skills,
such as researching, interviewing, and presenting. Students create video
news, aligned to themes in STELLAR, where they step into the roles of a
<a href="http://journalist.In" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">journalist.In</a>the second tier, a selected group of students further
hone their skills by producing newsworthy videos for KHS Live! This year,
KHS Live! has been extended to the learning of Chinese Language in support
of our school’s mission to empower Kong Hwaians with language skills and
cross-cultural appreciation that come with bilingualism in English and
Chinese languages. Students get a taste of the life of a journalist through
hands-on experiences such as reading up on current affairs, crafting interview
questions, conducting interviews, and video production. The programme concludes
in Primary 6 with interdisciplinary Project Work presentations. As we instil
joy and nurture a love for learning in students, we aim to sharpen their
critical and adaptive thinking skills while developing them to be effective
communicators.</p>
