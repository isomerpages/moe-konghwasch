#### Goal of MOE’s Cyber Wellness Curriculum

To equip our children with **life-long social-emotional competencies** **and sound values** so that they can become **safe, respectful responsible users** of ICT.

Cyber Wellness Curriculum in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

There are four cyber wellness themes.

•    **Cyber use** promotes balanced use of ICT. Are our students in control of their ICT use or are they a slave to technology?

•    **Cyber identity** promotes healthy self-identity online. A well-developed identity enables us to know our strengths, weaknesses, and individual uniqueness. Are they the same person both online and offline? How do our students manage their online reputation?

•    **Cyber relationship** helps students maintain a safe and meaningful one online. Do our students interact online with social-cultural sensitivities? In the lesson on cyber bullying, we teach our students to stand up for and to reach out to peers who are bullied online.

•    **Cyber citizenship** promotes positive presence through helping students understand the cyber world, know how to handle online content and manage contacts. Students learn to make informed decisions about their online participation. Are free Apps really free? How can students create and share their works online? The choices we make are guided by values and reveal our character and value system.
