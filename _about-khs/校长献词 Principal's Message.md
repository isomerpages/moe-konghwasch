<h4>校长献词</h4>
<p>秉承着 <strong>“育人为本，立德为先” </strong>的信念，光华校训“诚毅” 为每届的光华学子奠下 <strong>“诚以待人，毅以处事” </strong>的人生基石，培养他们学会待人处事的传统美德以及精益求精的坚韧精神。我们坚信，只有在育人的道路上扎根立足，方能在人生的航程中展翅高飞。</p>
<p>学校依然保留传统华校的优良校风和价值观。因为在这个全球化、多元化和快速变化的时代，孩子越是需要深厚的文化底蕴和价值观。我们希望光华学子在传统文化的熏陶和优良价值观的引领下，扎实本身文化和价值观的根基，能更有自信、能力和底气去面对未来的挑战。</p>
<p>学校愿景 <strong>“好学敏思，立己达人” </strong>，冀望每个光华学子积极学习，不断思考，超越自我，并饮水思源，以奉献社会为己任。</p>
<p><strong>"好学敏思"</strong> 涵盖了学习与思考的双重内涵，体现了《论语·为政》“学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆”的精髓。学习并非仅限于知识的获取，而是包括了深入思考的过程。学校在鼓励学生积极学习的同时，也引导他们不断反思，培养他们分析、辨别和创新的能力。这不仅能够帮助学生建立坚实的知识基础，还能够激发他们的创造力和解决问题的能力。因此学生在学习中不仅仅是被动接受知识，也必须能够主动地去思考、去探索、去创新。</p>
<p><strong>“立己达人”</strong>与《论语·雍也》中“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人” 的理念相契合，阐述了一个人应当以自身的成长与成就来影响和帮助他人的道理。学校强调学生不仅要不断提升自我，力求成为最优秀的自己；还必须以身作则，以积极的态度和行动去影响身边的人，传递正能量。我们教导学生怀有感恩之心，珍惜所拥有的一切，并学会与他人分享和关爱。通过社区服务，我们要学生回馈社会，培养他们成为具有爱心和社会责任感的公民。</p>
<p>父母皆盼子女成龙成凤，希望孩子能出人头地。身为校长，我不仅仅是希望我们光华的孩子学业有成，更要求他们品行端正。因为一个人的人生观、价值观正确了，才不会在人生的道路上走错方向。</p>
<p>建校至今，光华培育了不计其数品学兼优的光华学子，为他们的启蒙教育奠下了重要固基，其影响至深至远。光华团队会持续为孩子营造一个良好的学习环境。看着孩子们健康快乐地成长，成为拥有良好品格，积极向上向善的学生，是我们最大的动力和慰籍。</p>

<h4>Principal’s Message</h4>
<p>Rooted in the belief of <strong>"Character First"</strong>, the school
motto <strong>"Sincerity in Being, Perseverance in Doing"</strong> lays the
cornerstone of life for each succeeding generation of Kong Hwaians, fostering
in them the traditional virtues that shape their character and guide their
actions. It is our firm belief that anchoring oneself in character is essential
for unfurling one's wings and soaring in life.</p>
<p>The school continues to preserve the ethos and culture of Chinese-medium
schools. In this age of globalization, diversity and rapid changes, our
children would need to stay rooted in their cultural heritage and values
more than ever. It is our wish for every Kong Hwaian, through the influence
and appreciation of Chinese culture and values, strengthen the foundation
of their character and remain rooted in values, enabling them to face future
challenges with greater confidence, ability and strength.</p>
<p>The school vision <strong>“Learners with Thinking Minds, Leaders with Serving Hearts”</strong> encapsulates
our aspiration for Kong Hwaians to embody active learning and critical
thinking, continuously surpassing themselves, and humbly embracing grace
and gratitude in service of the community and nation.</p>
<p><strong>"Learners with Thinking Minds" </strong>exemplifies the intricate
relationship between learning and thinking, echoing an adage from the Analects
of Confucius: " Learning without thinking is futile, thinking without
learning is dangerous." Learning extends beyond mere acquisition of knowledge
to encompass deep thinking process. The school fosters an environment where
Kong Hwaians are not only encouraged to engage actively in learning but
also to continuously reflect, honing their abilities to analyze, discern
and innovate. This approach seeks not only to help students build a strong
foundation of knowledge, but also fosters their creativity and enhances
problem-solving skills. Thus, students are not passive recipients of knowledge
but rather active learners who think, explore and innovate.</p>
<p><strong>"Leaders with Serving Hearts"</strong> embodies the essence of
a maxim from the Analects of Confucius: "If one wishes to establish himself,
seeks also to establish others; If one wishes to enlarge himself, seeks
also to enlarge others." It expounds that a person should influence and
help others with their own growth and achievements. The school emphasizes
that Kong Hwaians should not only strive to improve and become the best
version of themselves, but also lead by example, positively influencing
those around them with positive energy. We teach our students to be grateful,
cherish what they have, and learn to share and care for others. Through
community service, we want Kong Hwaians to give back and contribute to
the well-being of others and the community, nurturing them to become compassionate
and socially responsible citizens.</p>
<p>All parents want the best for their children, and for them to be successful.
As principal, I believe true success lies not just in moulding exceptional
students, but in moulding exceptional people. Character is key in enabling
Kong Hwaians to navigate life's journey in the right direction.</p>
<p>Kong Hwa has stood the test of time and remains steadfast in its mission
to nurture generation after generation of students; laying the important
foundation for Kong Hwaians during their formative years - a bedrock with
profound and far-reaching influence in their developmental growth. To that
end, we will continue to maintain a positive and conducive learning environment
for our Kong Hwaians. Watching our children grow and learn with health,
joy, character, and drive is our greatest motivation and fulfillment.</p>
