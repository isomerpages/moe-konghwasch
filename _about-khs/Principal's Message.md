### PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE 2023

2023年是光华建校70周年的华诞。70年的风雨兼程，光华没有被历史的洪流淹没，仍屹立不摇，坚守教育岗位；70载的春华秋实，光华培育了一代又一代的学子，为他们奠下“诚以待人，毅以处事”的人生基石。

  

今年的校庆主题“扎根与展翅”，反映了学校的办学理念。首先，我们要光华学子在传统文化的熏陶和优良价值观的引领下，扎实文化与价值观的根基。我们希望走出光华校门的学生，品行端正并热爱本身的文化。另一方面，我们的孩子也将身处在一个全球化更显著、竞争更激烈、知识变化更急速的时代。他们需要不断自我超越，具有不畏挑战、不怕失败、勇于求新、敢于求变的精神，方能腾空展翅、凌风翱翔。其实，孩子越是要飞得高、飞得远，越是需要深厚的文化底蕴和价值观。

  

70年来，学校不断应变求新，为光华学子提供最优质的教育。建校70周年是个意义重大的里程碑，也同时标志着光华的另一个新起点。为展望学校的未来和谱写光华的新篇章，学校领导和老师，连同家长和校友，用了长达一年的时间共同构建了学校的新愿景和使命。

  

**愿景：好学敏思　立己达人**

**使命：明德正己　激发潜能 双语兼优　回馈社会**

  

学校与时俱进的同时，也不忘初衷，依然保留传统华校的优良校风和坚持“育人为本，立德为先”的信念。我最大的慰籍是看到孩子们都能成为孝顺懂事的子女和品学兼优的学生。

  

在新的一年里，殷切期盼您与我们再次携手同行，齐心擘画学校的新愿景和使命。让光华学子将根牢牢扎好，茁壮成长，并怀揣梦想，展翅高飞。

  

方小龙校长

  

  

2023 is a special year for Kong Hwa School as we will be celebrating our 70th anniversary milestone. Seventy years of growing from strength to strength and remaining steadfast in its mission as an education institution; Seventy years of nurturing generation after generation of students into upstanding members of society with “Sincerity and Perseverance”.

  

The theme of our 70th Anniversary celebrations is “Staying Rooted, Soaring High”, and it reflects the philosophy with which we approach education. We want our students to build their moral foundations with tradition and values and develop a love and appreciation for their culture and heritage. This “rootedness” is complemented with preparing for globalization, competition, and dynamism in the world of the future. Our students need the drive to improve, the dare to not be afraid of challenges and failures, to seek innovations and effect changes, so that they can soar. In fact, we believe that the higher and further we want our students to soar, the more they need to stay rooted in their cultural heritage and values.

  

Through the years, our school has continued to adapt and innovate, providing quality education for our students. Our 70th anniversary is a significant milestone in Kong Hwa’s illustrious history. It also marks a new chapter in our journey forward. Envisioning the future for Kong Hwa, the school leaders, teachers, together with parents and alumni embarked on a year-long re-envisioning exercise, and I am pleased to share with you our school’s new Vision and Mission.

  

**Our Vision:** 

**Learners with Thinking Minds, Leaders with Serving Hearts**

  

**Our Mission:** 

**Building Character, Realising Potentials, Nurturing Bilingualism, Serving Communities**

  

Kong Hwa will continue to preserve the ethos of Chinese-medium schools and remain anchored in its educational belief of “Character First”, whilst regenerating itself and innovating continuously in response to changing times. My greatest comfort stems from watching our children grow into filial and sensible sons and daughters, and our students excel in their character and learning.

  

I look forward to your continued partnership in 2023, in realising our new Vision and Mission. May our children stay rooted with their values and soar high with their dreams.
