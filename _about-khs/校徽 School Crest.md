### School Crest

<img height="500" src="/images/Logo.png width=">

The two Chinese characters&nbsp;**光华**&nbsp;form the torch. The torch is in red and it symbolises the “Flame of Knowledge”. The yellow background symbolises the radiance of the burning torch which reflects the school’s pursuit of excellence.

  

**‘光华’二字拼成一火炬，红色代表知识火焰， 黄色背景为火炬放出的光芒，代表学校追求卓越的精神。**
