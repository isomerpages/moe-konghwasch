<p>The KHS Way Framework offers a concise overview of the school's core principles
and strategic trajectory, all of which are aligned to the realization of
our mission and vision. At its foundation lie the bedrock encompassing
our belief (Character First), our motto (Sincerity &amp; Perseverance),
and our school values (KHS PR²IDE). Above, the apex of the framework outlines
the desired attributes for our staff, encapsulated by the acronym CARE
(Can-Do Spirit, Add-Value, Reflective, Energise), all underpinned by our
deeply ingrained Culture of Growth &amp; Positivity.</p>
