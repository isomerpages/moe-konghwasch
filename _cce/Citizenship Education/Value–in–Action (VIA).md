### Value–in–Action (VIA)

#### Student Advocacy of Meaningful Causes

At Kong Hwa School, we want our students to take the lead, and in collaboration with external organisations, we provide platforms for students to become advocates of good causes for the community.

#### Green Movement

The Ecobuddies programme is a collaborative project with Dunman High School. The programme guides our P4 and P5 Green Captains towards character and cognitive excellence through role-modelling by their DHS seniors, and the inculcation of appropriate environmental values and attitudes. The Green Captains learn to better manage themselves, build up better social relationships with their peers and become more aware of themselves through the Ecobuddies activities, gaining greater clarity on how they can do their part as Green Captains in environmental education.

#### Kindness Movement

Our Kindness Ambassadors, or Friends of Singa, do their part in spreading the message of kindness. Every year, our Kindness Ambassadors plan and execute a kindness project during Kindness Week, focusing on a theme by the Singapore Kindness Movement, and reaching out to the hearts of the community and the school.

#### The NE Show

The National Education Show is a rousing opportunity for our Primary 5 students to develop greater understanding of our nation’s growth and a sense of belonging to Singapore. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our Primary 5 students to preview the National Day Parade with their classmates and teachers, their love for our country is strengthened through the show, while taking heed of the trials and tribulations faced by our nation builders.
