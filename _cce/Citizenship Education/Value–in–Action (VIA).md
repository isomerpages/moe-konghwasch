### Value–in–Action (VIA)

The Values in Action level programmes prepare Kong Hwaians for a lifetime of active citizenship and contribution, involving them in projects to serve the school and the community. Progressively, our students expand their sphere of influence from P1 to P6, beginning with the home and the classroom, to the school, the wider community, and the world. 

“德育在于行动”让光华人为终身积极的公民身份和贡献做好准备，让他们参与到种种为学校和社区服务的公益计划。 我们的学生逐渐将他们的公益影响范围从小一扩展到小六 \- 从家庭和课堂中开始，扩展到学校、更广泛的社区，甚至于世界。

They also execute a secret mission in _Project Encourage_, swiftly cleaning up the classroom of a target P6 class when its occupants are not around, and leaving notes of encouragement to the P6 seniors for their impending PSLE. |

Going from class to class to spread awareness, our P4 Kong Hwaians also educate their schoolmates on donation etiquette, and sensitivities to the needs of beneficiaries. |

Hosted in our school, the programme has received rave reviews from the seniors who praise the little ones for their patience and care as they interact with them over craft work, smartphone apps, and other engaging and practical topics. |

A day out at the beach, our P6 Kong Hwaians take on the roles of environmental advocate and big brother/sister as they guide kindergarteners from PCF for a combined beach clean-up. The interaction between P6s and the kindergarteners is precious, with many of our P6 Kong Hwaians displaying tender, patient and loving sides otherwise unseen by their teachers. |
