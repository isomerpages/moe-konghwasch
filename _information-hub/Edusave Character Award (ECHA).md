<h4><strong>EDUSAVE CHARACTER AWARD (ECHA)</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE introduced
the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to recognise students who demonstrate
exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour
and actions. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and
stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged
and applauded. The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing
students of good values and character, who are active contributors and
concerned citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objectives
of the ECHA are:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To send a clear and
strong signal of the importance that MOE places on character and values,
on par with achievements in the academic domain; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To recognise outstanding
students in each school who are exemplary in character, and who can be
role models to inspire others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECHA awardees
