<h3>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to recognise
students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities
through their behaviour and actions. This is part of the larger goal to
foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities
and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports
schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character,
who are active contributors and concerned citizens.</p>

character, and who can be role models to inspire others.</p>
