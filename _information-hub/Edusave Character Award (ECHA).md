### Edusave Character Award (ECHA)


1) MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.

##### Objectives 

2)	The objectives of the ECHA are: <br>
•	To send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places on character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain; and <br>
