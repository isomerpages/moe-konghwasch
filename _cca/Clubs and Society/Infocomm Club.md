#### Achievements & Highlights of 2019

  

Our members took part in the Make X SG 2019. Even though we did not clinch any awards for Kong Hwa Infocomm Club, the experience was the best gift. Our members enjoyed themselves during the event. It was an enriching journey for all of us from mBot training with our fellow club members to competition preparatory sessions.

Achievements & Highlights of 2018

  

Robotics Infocomm members were introduced to LEGO Mindstorms® EV3. Working collaboratively in conquering different “quests” every session, members learnt different commands and programming structures. They also did troubleshooting, explored and shared solutions among teams.   

  

Though throughout the modules, it was not smooth-sailing and members faced several hiccups in their coding, it was heartening that they persevered through and showed resilience. They were also eager and willing to share their solutions with teams.
