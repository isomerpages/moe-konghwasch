#### Recreational Table Tennis

Recreational Table Tennis aims to instill values such as sportsmanship and resilience in our students. Besides developing the soft skills, the CCA also aims to cultivate in students the love for the sport. Students will be learning the basic skills of the game as well as the fundamental knowledge of the game such as the rules and point system. Responsibility is also instilled in students when they are being tasked to set up and keep the logistics needed for their CCA sessions. By the end of P6, we hope that every player is able to play the game as well as developing a bond with the sport and their fellow CCA peers.
