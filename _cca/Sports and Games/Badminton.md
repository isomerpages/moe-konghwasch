#### Brief description of Badminton CCA  

There are two different categories of badminton teams in Kong Hwa School. They are School Team and Recreational Team. 

  

For School Team, pupils are given the opportunity to be playing in competitions. There are junior boys and girls team which comprises of pupils from P3 to P5 and senior boys and girls team which comprises of P6 pupils. These groups of pupils train three times a week. Selections will be held for pupils from P2 and P3 if they want to enter the school team.

  

For Recreational Team, pupils will play badminton at a non-competitive environment. They train once a week. This team comprises of pupils from P3 to P6 and is suitable for pupils of all entry level. Through regular trainings, pupils are able to improve their badminton skills, social skills, physical fitness and develop values like teamwork, integrity and sportsmanship.
