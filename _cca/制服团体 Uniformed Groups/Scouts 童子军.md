<p>Scouting is about having fun, but to a Cub Scout, “fun” means a lot more
than just having a good time. "Fun" is a cub scout’s code word for the
satisfaction he gets from meeting challenges, having friends, feeling good
about himself, and feeling he is important to other people.</p>
<p>While cub scouts are having fun and doing things they like to do, they
also learn new things, discover and master new skills and be rewarded with
proficiency badges, gain self-confidence and positive values, and develop
strong friendships.</p>
