<p><strong>Guiding Vision</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The voice of girls who influence issues they care about and strive to build a better world.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Guiding Mission</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>To enable girls to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.</strong>
</p>
<p>Brownies are encouraged to explore and become more independent. They are
constantly learning new skills and challenged to try new and adventurous
activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and
do in the future.</p>
<p>Brownies learn to work and play independently and also in teams. On special
occasions, Brownies do fun things together with other Brownie or Girl Guide
units for joint learning adventures! Activities may include Division Days
and outdoor cooking. Along the way, they learn to care for each other and
other people around them and make lasting friendships.</p>
<p><strong>5-Point Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Brownies are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops
them in 5 areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal &amp; Social Development – Healthy Me, Courteous Me, Cultured
Me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home – Home Safety &amp; Duties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outdoor – Discovering Nature, A Green World</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community – My Country, My Neighbourhood, Helper</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>Brownies enjoy working for interest badges and awards that will help them
develop new skills.</p>
