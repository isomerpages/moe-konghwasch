### Table Tennis

The Kong Hwa School Table tennis CCA comprises of 2 groups which are School Team and the Recreational Team. The activities conducted for each group are pitched according to the pupils’ abilities and readiness so that they are continually engaged in CCA sessions.

  

For the school team, pupils are given the opportunity to play in the National School Games (NSG) competition where they can apply their skills in a competitive setting. Through their experience during competition, they will be able to learn on how to realign their focus on the process rather than its outcome. The junior boys and girls teams comprise of pupils from P3 to P5. The senior boys and girls teams are made up of selected P5 & P6 pupils. These groups of pupils train three times a week.

  

Recreational Table Tennis aims to instill values such as sportsmanship and resilience in our students. Besides developing the soft skills, the CCA also aims to cultivate in pupils the love for the sport. Pupils will learn the basic skills of the game as well as the fundamental knowledge of the game such as the rules and point system. The value of responsibility is also instilled in students when they are being tasked to set up and keep the logistics needed for their CCA sessions.

  

By the end of P6, we hope that every player is able to play the game as well as develop a bond with the sport and their fellow CCA peers.
