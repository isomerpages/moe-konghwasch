<p>The Kong Hwa School Table tennis CCA comprises of 2 groups which are School
Team and the Recreational Team. The activities conducted for each group
are pitched according to the pupils’ abilities and readiness so that they
are continually engaged in CCA sessions.</p>
<p>For the school team, pupils are given the opportunity to play in the National
School Games (NSG) competition where they can apply their skills in a competitive
setting. Through their experience during competition, they will be able
to learn on how to realign their focus on the process rather than its outcome.
The junior boys and girls teams comprise of pupils from P3 to P5. The senior
boys and girls teams are made up of selected P5 &amp; P6 pupils. These
groups of pupils train three times a week.</p>
<p>Recreational Table Tennis aims to instill values such as sportsmanship
and resilience in our students. Besides developing the soft skills, the
CCA also aims to cultivate in pupils the love for the sport. Pupils will
learn the basic skills of the game as well as the fundamental knowledge
of the game such as the rules and point system. The value of responsibility
is also instilled in students when they are being tasked to set up and
keep the logistics needed for their CCA sessions.</p>
<p>By the end of P6, we hope that every player is able to play the game as
well as develop a bond with the sport and their fellow CCA peers.</p>
