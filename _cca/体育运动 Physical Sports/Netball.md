<p>Netball is a Co-Curricular Activity for girls. It is a ball game played
by two teams of seven players. In this CCA, the girls will learn how to
send and receive a ball through various passes like the Chest pass, the
Lob and the Bounce Pass. They will also learn how to shoot the ball into
the hoop of the goal post. The object of the game is to send the ball into
the opponent’s territory and shoot it into the hoop at a goal post.</p>
<p>The focus of the school’s Netball CCA is inculcate in the girls a love
for the sport in the hope that they would continue to play the sport as
a life-long pursuit, not only for enjoyment but as a healthy pursuit to
keep them fit and healthy.</p>
