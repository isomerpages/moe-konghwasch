<h3>Chess Club (International Chess, Xiangqi &amp; Weiqi)</h3>
<p>It’s not about the Kings, Queens, and Rooks, but rather, quadrants and
coordinates, thinking strategically and foreseeing consequences. It’s about
lines and angles, weighing options and making decisions. Chess might just
be the perfect teaching and learning tool.</p>
<p>The goal of Kong Hwa School Chess Club (International Chess, Chinese Chess
and Weiqi) is to use the game of chess as a tool, to increase higher level
thinking skills, advance math and reading skills, and build self-confidence.</p>
<p>Research shows, there is a strong correlation between learning to play
chess and academic achievement. A landmark study found that students who
received chess instruction scored significantly higher on all measures
of academic achievement, including math, spatial analysis, and non-verbal
reasoning ability (Smith and Cage, 2000).</p>
<p>Chess have a positive impact on kids in school. Our students’ minds and
thinking skills are developing rapidly, and chess teaches higher level
thinking skills such as the ability to visualize, analyze, and think critically.</p>
<p>As children play the chess, they begin to see the importance of thinking
ahead, trying to figure out what their opponent might do next and what
their alternatives are too. This ability to anticipate outcomes can transfer
to their reading comprehension. Students can predict outcomes, and realize
that characters in their stories are interconnected, just as just as they
and their opponent, and the pieces on the chessboard are.</p>
