### Chess Club (International Chess, Xiangqi &amp; Weiqi)

It’s not about the Kings, Queens, and Rooks, but rather, quadrants and coordinates, thinking strategically and foreseeing consequences. It’s about lines and angles, weighing options and making decisions. Chess might just be the perfect teaching and learning tool.

  

The goal of Kong Hwa School Chess Club (International Chess, Chinese Chess and Weiqi) is to use the game of chess as a tool, to increase higher level thinking skills, advance math and reading skills, and build self-confidence.

  

Research shows, there is a strong correlation between learning to play chess and academic achievement. A landmark study found that students who received chess instruction scored significantly higher on all measures of academic achievement, including math, spatial analysis, and non-verbal reasoning ability (Smith and Cage, 2000).

  

Chess have a positive impact on kids in school. Our students’ minds and thinking skills are developing rapidly, and chess teaches higher level thinking skills such as the ability to visualize, analyze, and think critically.

  

As children play the chess, they begin to see the importance of thinking ahead, trying to figure out what their opponent might do next and what their alternatives are too. This ability to anticipate outcomes can transfer to their reading comprehension. Students can predict outcomes, and realize that characters in their stories are interconnected, just as just as they and their opponent, and the pieces on the chessboard are.
