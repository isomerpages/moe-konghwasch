### Wushu

In Wushu, the students will develop an understanding of the fundamental skills of Wushu, Quanshu and various weapons. Wushu serves more as a medium in the teaching of Chinese culture and tradition. By combining physical exercise and cultural study, Wushu lessons help foster students’ enthusiasm and love for the ancient sport in each gesture and move. They will achieve character development and personal growth in areas such as self-discipline, confidence, resilience and teamwork.

  

Over the years, our Wushu Team had put up many performances in school and also took part in the annual National Inter-Primary School Wushu Championships.
