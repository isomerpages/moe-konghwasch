#### Brief description of Chinese Orchestra  

* * *

In Kong Hwa School, our Chinese Orchestra (CO) is led by our esteemed CO conductor, Mr. Liu Bin. Coupled with a team of dedicated KHS teachers and our highly qualified instructors, we aim to develop all our members holistically with an edge in their musical talent in Chinese Orchestra.  
  
Our members learn life-skills such as team work, perseverance and commitment when the various sections of the orchestra work collaboratively together to perform as an orchestra. We view attendance, punctuality, preparedness, consistent effort and positive attitude in our members as quintessential criteria to bring out the best in each and every member in KHS CO.  
  
As part of our effort to build stronger musical foundation in the various Chinese instruments for potential members in CO, the school has started the Beginners’ Program to recruit young musicians in Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils to give them a head start in experiencing and learning the Chinese musical instruments. Upon selection based on their performance in the Beginners’ Program, they will be encouraged to take up CO as their CCA in P3 to continue their learning experience till Primary 6. We seeks to build continuity and commitment in their learning journey as a musician over the 6 years when they are with us so that we can help to fully actualise their potential as a musician.  
  
We are also proud to be the only primary school in Singapore that has attained 3 consecutive Gold with Honours award in the past Singapore Youth Festivals and had clinched the highest award of Distinction in 2018 SYF. We look forward to participating in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF) in 2020 and work towards yet another year of outstanding achievement.  
  
In addition to our outstanding achievements in national platforms like the SYFs, we also strive to provide showcasing opportunities for our members within schools through events like Chinese New Year, KHS Aesthetic Showcase and beyond schools at Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan and other venues.
