### Scouts

Scouting is about having fun, but to a Cub Scout, “fun” means a lot more than just having a good time. "Fun" is a cub scout’s code word for the satisfaction he gets from meeting challenges, having friends, feeling good about himself, and feeling he is important to other people.

  

While cub scouts are having fun and doing things they like to do, they also learn new things, discover and master new skills and be rewarded with proficiency badges, gain self-confidence and positive values, and develop strong friendships.

  

**You’ll want to join Scouts if you enjoy**

*   Camp Craft – outdoor cooking, tent pitching
