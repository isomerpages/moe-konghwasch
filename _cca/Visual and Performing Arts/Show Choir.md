### Show Choir

Do you have a love for singing and performance?

  

The Kong Hwa Show Choir welcomes you to join our fun, energetic and dynamic team!

  

Together, we learn to perform cohesively and confidently by combining different elements of singing, dancing and acting into a Show Choir performance at the recreational and competitive levels.

  

It is also a great learning platform for you to develop your values of perseverance, team work and discipline. The group ensemble experience will definitely greatly enhance your social and cooperative skills too!
